<h1>Clone of Ajio.com</h1>


Home Page:

To make this page, I used basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript. To store data, I took the help of local storage. I used functionalities like swiper, slider, pagination, navigation etc. I have also included navbar and footer section which is working perfectly fine.

Product Page:
<img width="98%" src="./images/mensection.png" alt="" />

To create product page, I stored the data in array of objects. I used functionalities like sorting, filtering, adding to cart(with the use of local storage), total items etc. All these have been completed with HTML, CSS , Javascript only.

Login/Signup Page:

In this section, I used form tag. I stored the user data in local storage and to login, we matched the data from there.

Cart Page:
<img width="98%" src="./images/addcart.png" alt="" />

In cart section, I fetched the data from local storage. Using javascript, I implemented functionalities like delete, increase or decrease the quantity of product, total amount , coupon application, payment gateway etc.

Address and Payment Page:
<img width="98%" src="./images/addresspage.png" alt="" />
<img width="98%" src="./images/paymentpage.png" alt="" />
When I enter our address and click on submit button, it will redirect to payment page and after filling all the details correctly, it will redirect to OTP page and after entering OTP, our payment process will be completed.

Challenges Faced:
merging of codes was one of the challenge.
